WiFi_Check

Purpose:
This script checks to see if the computer is able to ping
the gateway of the network. The original implementation of
this project was unable to handle computers which have
static IP addresses, which was fixed by mharizanov.

I have added the ability to get the gateway from the
/etc/network/interfaces file and then run ping -c 1 on that
gateway IP address.

Uses a lock file which prevents the script from running more
than one at a time.  If lockfile is old, it removes it
